# Employee-_data
Attach the project to the Git and generate Readme of experiment 1.2




**Index.html**



 **DESCRIPTION**
 This HTML document creates a web page for displaying an employee salary table. Here's a short description of the code:
It defines an HTML5 document structure with metadata and a title.
There's a CSS <style> section that styles a table, headings, and buttons.
The page contains an employee salary table with columns for Name, UID, City, Jobrole, and Salary.
JavaScript functions are included:
show(): Sets predefined salary values for employees when the "show" button is clicked.
tsalary(): Calculates and displays the total salary of all employees when the "Total Salary" button is clicked. However, there's a missing data5 variable and an issue setting the total salary value.
The code has some structural and logical issues, such as the missing data5 variable and an attempt to set a non-existent element's value for total salary.

**INDEX.JS**

       

**DESCRIPTION**
This Node.js code is designed to create a simple HTTP server that serves an HTML file and appends a "Total Salary" message to it. Here's a description of the code:
Importing Modules:
fs and fs1 (File System): These modules are used to read and write files. fs.promises is used for asynchronous file operations, and fs1 is used for synchronous file operations.
http: This module is used to create an HTTP server.
readFile Function:

This asynchronous function is defined to read a file given a filePath.
It uses fs.promises.readFile to read the file asynchronously.
If the file is successfully read, it logs the file's content to the console and then writes the same content to a new file named "newFile.html" using fs.promises.writeFile.
Reading and Serving HTML File with HTTP Server:
